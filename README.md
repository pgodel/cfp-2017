# I want to talk

Dear speaker, welcome to the Symfony Catalunya 2017. We will explain you what does being our speaker mean, and how easy
is to be part of the adventure. And you don't have to leave Github!

Here we have some points that you need to have in mind before proposing any talk. They are all requisites for all
our chosen talks, so read from A to Z.

- All talks *must* be unique and the first time exposed. All talks done before will be tagged as **repeated** and will
be automatically discarted.
- Your talk should be about 40 minutes long. You will have around 10 minutes at the end for Q&A.
- Add as many proposals as you want
- This year we will focus on Symfony, the Framework, the Components and the way you can mix it with many other technologies.
This means that Symfony must be part important of the talk, not an extra at the end.
- In order to follow a common format, please, visit the [CFP Example](https://github.com/symfony-cat/cfp-2017/issues/2)
- In your description, make sure everyone understand your talk's point. You have the responsibility to chose the format of the
description; long, short, with images... feel free to expose to the world your idea the same way you have it in your mind.
- Once submitted, our audience will have the possibility to vote your talk, so... make sure you do good campaign with it.
- Share you talk in your social networks to find votes. The more votes you have, the more probabilities you have to became a
new Symfony Catalunya 2017 speaker

As speaker we offer you this package

- Your conference ticket, for free
- We pay your hotel during the conference
- We pay you your flights
- Some extra surprises... come and discover them :)

The way we will chose the talks for the conference will be a mix of people's votes and our veredict. We expose you what will
our veredict take in account.

- The quality of the talk
- The quality of the speaker **as a speaker**. If you publish videos or slides, that will help us a lot, so make sure that, if
you have some links, add them in your proposals. Does it mean that a new speaker will not have any chance? Of course not. We
will have in mind that everyone is part of the conference, and if the talk is good, the changes grow. If you're new, why
don't you publish something about you in video? Make us a demonstration, this will increase your visibility and will help us
a lot as well.
- The audience reactions to the proposal, and the feedback from other conferences

# I want to vote

Do you want to vote? Add these reactions in the Issue. Adding a reaction is not commenting it with emoticons. You will find
a button in the top-right of the issue where you can add reactions.
- üëç I like it!
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Shut up and take my money!

We ask you all that, if a talk is not from your interest, just think that *is not of your interest*, and don't thumb it
down. Take in account that not everyone is used of doing talks or proposing them, so be respectful with everyone.

Add comments if you want to, that will make more dynamic the process and will help everyone to understand whay you, the
audience, expect from this new Symfony Catalunya 2017
